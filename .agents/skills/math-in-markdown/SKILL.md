Apply the following conventions when writing math in `.md` files.

## Delimiters

- Inline: `$...$`
- Display block: `$$...$$`

## Variable naming

Use single-letter variable names (or single-letter with a subscript, e.g. $v_0$) so formulas can
be pasted into Desmos. Define each variable in surrounding prose or a variable list near where it
is introduced.

Use Desmos function names wherever a Desmos equivalent exists (e.g. `sign` not `sgn`). Desmos
uses `arctan(y, x)` as its two-argument atan2.

## GitHub rendering pitfalls

GitHub's markdown preprocessor intercepts `\` followed by any punctuation character before MathJax
sees it. Avoid `\,` `\;` `\!` `\:` and any other `\`+punctuation sequence inside math.
`\`+letter sequences (e.g. `\qquad`, `\bigl`) are safe.

`\operatorname` is on GitHub's macro denylist. Use `\mathop{\text{...}}` instead — it gives
correct operator spacing. Plain `\text{}` works but lacks operator spacing.

Use `^\circ` for degrees inside math expressions, not the Unicode `°` character.
